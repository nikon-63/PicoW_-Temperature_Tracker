# Raspberry Pi Pico W Temperature Monitoring with SQL Database Integration

## Overview
This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller board, a temperature sensor, and an OLED screen to monitor real-time temperature readings. The temperature data is then sent to a SQL database using PHP for efficient storage and retrieval.

## Features
- Read temperature data from a sensor connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
- Display real-time temperature readings on an OLED screen.
- Store temperature data in a SQL database for long-term logging.
- PHP script to handle data insertion into the database.

## Skills developed during this project
1. Understanding the differences between Micro Python and Python, including the different libraries.
2. Interfacing GPIO pins (OLED screen, temperature sensor and push button).
3. Developing a solid understanding of the 1-wire serial communication protocol used by the temperature sensor.
4. The process of setting up a MySQL database.
5. Exploring different methods of sending data from the Pico to the MySQL database.
6. Introduction to PHP and MySQL connect to insert data into the database.
7. Networking on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
